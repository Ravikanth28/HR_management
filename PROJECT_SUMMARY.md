   - Direct skill matches from candidate profile
   - Text-based skill detection in resume content
   - Weighted scoring based on skill importance

2. **Experience Bonus (0-10 points)**
   - Entry level: 0-2 years preferred
   - Mid level: 2-7 years preferred
   - Senior level: 5+ years preferred
   - Lead level: 8+ years preferred

3. **Education Bonus (0-10 points)**
   - Relevant degree detection
   - Institution recognition
   - Field of study matching

**Final Score**: Combination of all factors (max 100%)

## 🎨 User Interface Highlights
